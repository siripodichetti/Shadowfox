# Enhanced Calculator

This is a simple yet improved console-based calculator built using Java.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations, scientific calculations, and even some quick unit conversions.  
The goal of this project was to strengthen understanding of Java basics like methods, user input, and control flow.

##  Features
- Basic Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division  
- Scientific Functions: Square Root and Exponentiation  
- Unit Conversions: Temperature (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit) and Currency (INR ↔ USD)


##  How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.  
2. Open your terminal or command prompt inside the project folder.  
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac EnhancedCalculator.java
4. Run the program:
   java EnhancedCalculator
